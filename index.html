<!-- This was frustrating at first, but I learned some basics to JavaScript in the process.
Hope this is close, was unsure if it needed to be a visual puzzle with <ul></ul>
or not, but it all works in the console.log on first click and then if repeated 
an alert message is displayed with "already been done" -->
